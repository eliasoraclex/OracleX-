OracleX: A Decentralized Prediction Ecosystem Powered by Proof-of-Behavior

What is OracleX?
OracleX is a fully decentralized prediction ecosystem that enables participants to directly aggregate and contribute information without relying on centralized intermediaries. Built on the Proof-of-Behavior (PoB) protocol, OracleX combines a dual-token economic model (OEX and USDX) with a unique staking mechanism to incentivize high-quality participation and ensure the integrity of predictions.

Key Features

1.Proof-of-Behavior (PoB) Protocol
￮Users stake OEX (the governance and equity token) to mint USDX (a stable medium of exchange pegged to 1 USDT).
￮Daily prediction activities ("valid behavior") are required to activate mining rewards, ensuring continuous and meaningful participation.
￮Rewards are dynamically adjusted based on prediction accuracy, frequency, and volume, aligning incentives with truthful information contribution.

2.Algorithmic Stability Mechanisms
￮Dynamic Minting Ratio: The USDX minting ratio adjusts algorithmically (between 0.1–0.5) based on market conditions to prevent over-leverage and maintain system health.
￮Soft Liquidation: Instead of forced liquidations, users temporarily lose mining rewards when collateralization ratios drop below safe thresholds. These rewards are automatically redirected to replenish their staked OEX, reducing market panic and sell pressure.
￮Hybrid Anchor: USDX stability is backed by both algorithmic adjustments and a Central Reserve Fund (CRF) of fiat-backed stablecoins (e.g., USDT), ensuring reliability even during extreme volatility.

3.Decentralized Governance and Dispute Resolution
￮A Wager-Based Governance system allows users to challenge event outcomes by staking OEX. Disputes are resolved through DAO voting, with penalties for dishonest behavior.
￮This mechanism ensures trustless and transparent arbitration without centralized control.

4.Sustainable Tokenomics
￮OEX Mining Incentives: Early adopters earn OEX through PoB mining, with rewards designed to decay exponentially over time.
￮Transaction Fees: A portion of fees from prediction events is used to buy back and burn OEX, creating deflationary pressure and long-term value.

Disclaimer: OracleX is an experimental protocol. Users should conduct their own research and understand the risks before participating.
